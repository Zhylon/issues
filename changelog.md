# Zhylon.de Release Notes
Here we track your feature request and the release updates

## 2022-10-15
We have added the [Hetzner-Cloud-API](https://docs.hetzner.cloud) in our portfolio.
This makes it possible to deploy new servers inside your [Hetzner-Cloud Portal](https://hetzner-cloud.de/).

You can add your Hetzner API Keys to your personal credentials to enable this deployment Provider.

Unfortunately, other partners dropped out again this year, so that we had to further restrict the services of Zhylon.de.
In the future we will only offer our "Beta Services". These are not available to the public.

This generally means that all services operated by Zhylon.de can only be used in the form of a beta subscription with immediate effect. All subscriptions are automatically rewritten. It will not be charged.

In the future, we will issue all invoices with 0 EUR and show the corresponding discount.
Any entitlement to the availability of the services is thereby also extinguished. We are still trying to achieve an availability of >99%, but if a server fails or we switch off the server, then there will be no refund for this.

Of course we hope that you will still stick by us. You can support us by joining our channels, helping us with development or hosting. Or you can make a small contribution to us via the appropriate platforms.

We hope that we can go back to normal operations at some point.

We have canceled the partnership with Dengo, as we do not consider a future with
this partner to be meaningful.

available via private hosting.
We also have the option of using one-click installations completely discarded.

As the PHP Framework Laravel gains in popularity, we have decided to focus on
this technology. We have therefore rewritten the entire backend. The result is
that we focus our services on PHP projects.

That's why we present our new **deplyoment service**. With it you can easily
deploy your PHP projects to a server provided by us. And best of all, your
project remains 100% accessible. There will be 0 seconds down time between each
deplyoment. Also the following features are included now:
- zero downtime deployment for your PHP Projects
- easily deploy your server and keep it up to date
- many **one-click-installations** like WordPress, TYPO3 or Drupal
- Sync your project with GitHub
